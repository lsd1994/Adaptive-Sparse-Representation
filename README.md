# Adaptive-Sparse-Representation
Adaptive sparse representation based on visual saliency for inamge compression.For salient region,it gives more sparsity level (0-norm) to further improve performance.This code is a simple implementation of paper:

**Image compression using adaptive sparse representations over trained dictionaries**

I'm not ensure the correctness of the code,and the dictionary isn't trained as described in the paper.So please use carefully.

To use this code,you should unzip the gbvs.zip file first and install gbvs,more details in http://www.klab.caltech.edu/~harel/share/gbvs.php

If you have any questions or find mistakes on this code,please contact my:lsd1994@163.com
