# Adaptive-Sparse-Representation
Adaptive sparse representation based on visual saliency for inamge compression.For salient region,it gives more sparsity level (0-norm) tofurther improve performance.This code is simple implementation of paper:

''Image compression using adaptive sparse representations over trained dictionaries''

I'm not sure the correctness of the code,and the dictionary isn't trained as mentioned in the paper.So please use carefully.

To use this code,you should install gbvs first,more details in http://www.klab.caltech.edu/~harel/share/gbvs.php
